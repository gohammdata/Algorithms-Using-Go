<h1>Algorithms with GO</h1>

<p>Decided to write an algorithm repo for Go as I am also writing one in C/C++. I am MUCH more of an expert, dare I say an actual expert in Go, (I mean the gopher profile picture says it all right? lol jk) so the process will be quicker and easier. It will also make writing any using C/C++ easier when I have the written optimized algorithms out here to just convert over.</p>

<p>
 BOTTOM LINE: I am borderline proficient using the tool of C/C++ (and will be completely proficient soon), but I am 100% fluent in Go; and when it comes to writing these algorithms I want to devote time to creating the algorithms rather than the tool (programming language).
