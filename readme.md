<h1>Algorithms with GO</h1>



<p>
 BOTTOM LINE: I am borderline proficient using the tool of C/C++ (and will be completely proficient soon), but I am 100% fluent in Go; and when it comes to writing these algorithms I want to devote time to creating the algorithms rather than the tool (programming language).
